# Product Requirements Document: Google Tasks Integration for Obsidian Reminder Plugin

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for integrating Google Tasks with the Obsidian Reminder plugin. The integration will allow users to synchronize their Obsidian reminders with Google Tasks, providing cross-platform access and additional functionality.

## Background
The Obsidian Reminder plugin currently provides robust reminder functionality within Obsidian, including notification systems like system notifications and ntfy integration. Adding Google Tasks integration will extend the plugin's capabilities by connecting to Google's widely-used task management service.

## Objectives
1. Allow users to synchronize Obsidian reminders with Google Tasks
2. Implement a secure OAuth 2.0 authorization flow with PKCE
3. Provide user settings to configure the integration
4. Maintain user privacy and data security
5. Ensure a smooth user experience with appropriate feedback

## User Requirements
1. Users should be able to enable/disable Google Tasks integration
2. Users should be able to authenticate with Google securely
3. Users should receive clear feedback about the sync status
4. Users should be able to view their Obsidian reminders in Google Tasks
5. The integration should respect user privacy and security

## Functional Requirements

### Authentication
1. Implement OAuth 2.0 with PKCE flow for Google authentication
2. Store authentication tokens securely
3. Provide a mechanism to refresh expired tokens
4. Allow users to revoke access
5. Handle authentication errors gracefully

### Settings
1. Add a toggle to enable/disable Google Tasks integration
2. Add Google Tasks related settings to the plugin settings tab
3. Store user preferences persistently

### Synchronization
1. Create a dedicated task list for Obsidian reminders in Google Tasks
2. Synchronize reminder title, date, and note information
3. Sync reminders during the plugin's periodic task checks
4. Provide visual feedback during synchronization
5. Handle synchronization errors gracefully

### User Interface
1. Provide authentication status feedback
2. Show synchronization status
3. Offer clear error messages and recovery options
4. Maintain the existing UI aesthetics of the plugin

## Technical Requirements

### Google Tasks Service
1. Create a `GoogleTasksService` class to handle all Google Tasks operations
2. Implement methods for authentication, token management, and task operations
3. Handle API requests and responses securely

### OAuth Implementation
1. Implement a secure PKCE-based OAuth flow
2. Set up a local server for handling OAuth redirects
3. Securely manage access and refresh tokens
4. Handle token expiration and refresh

### Integration with Existing Plugin
1. Integrate with the notification worker for synchronized updates
2. Extend the plugin settings to include Google Tasks options
3. Expose the Google Tasks service through the plugin interface

## Data Flow
1. User enables Google Tasks integration in settings
2. User authenticates with Google via OAuth 2.0 with PKCE
3. Plugin stores authentication tokens securely
4. During periodic checks, plugin synchronizes reminders with Google Tasks
5. Synchronization creates or updates tasks in the dedicated task list
6. User receives feedback about synchronization status

## Security Considerations
1. Use PKCE flow to secure the OAuth process
2. Store tokens securely using browser storage
3. Implement secure error handling to prevent information leakage
4. Request minimal necessary permissions from Google API

## Implementation Details

### Google Tasks Service (`src/plugin/google-tasks.ts`)
The core service handling all Google Tasks operations, including:
- Authentication flow with PKCE
- Token management
- Task creation and management
- Error handling

### Settings Extensions (`src/plugin/settings/index.ts`)
Add Google Tasks related settings:
- Enable/disable Google Tasks integration toggle
- Additional configuration options as needed

### Main Plugin Integration (`src/main.ts`)
Integrate the Google Tasks service with the main plugin:
- Initialize the Google Tasks service
- Provide methods for authentication and synchronization
- Handle user feedback

### Plugin Export Update (`src/plugin/index.ts`)
Export the Google Tasks service for use in other parts of the plugin.

## Limitations and Constraints
1. Requires internet connectivity for synchronization
2. Relies on Google Tasks API availability
3. Limited to one-way sync (Obsidian → Google Tasks) initially
4. Requires user to complete OAuth flow in a browser

## Future Enhancements
1. Bidirectional synchronization (Google Tasks → Obsidian)
2. Selective synchronization of specific reminders
3. Custom mapping of reminder fields to Google Tasks fields
4. Conflict resolution for changes made in both systems
5. Offline operation with synchronization queue

## Success Metrics
1. User adoption rate of the Google Tasks integration feature
2. Reduction in manual task entry across platforms
3. User satisfaction and feedback
4. Error rates during synchronization
5. Authentication success rates

## Timeline
1. Phase 1: Basic OAuth implementation and Google Tasks service (Current)
2. Phase 2: Integration with notification worker for automatic syncing
3. Phase 3: Enhanced error handling and user feedback
4. Phase 4: Testing and refinement
5. Phase 5: Documentation and release
